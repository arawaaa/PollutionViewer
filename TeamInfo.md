## Project Summary

Pollution is a critical concern in the United States, with adverse health effects that vary across different regions. This project aims to develop a frontend application that will provide a user-friendly interface to explore pollution levels in different areas of the United States. The application will focus on displaying time-averaged heatmaps for individual pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) data by region. The goal is to inform users on pollutants in each area, show potential health concerns with pollutants, while also allowing users to input their own reviews on how bad pollutants are in an area. This will provide policy-makers, researchers, and the general population valuable insights on air quality, pollution, and public health concerns.
